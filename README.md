## Quick Start Guide

Just want to get chatting? Follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Python** (if you don't have it):
   - Download Python 3.7 or higher from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

2. **Download this app**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Benavidez/GroupChat.git
   cd GroupChat
   ```

3. **Set up the app**:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv

   # Activate it:
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install required packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Initialize the database
   python3 init_db.py
   ```

4. **Start the chat**:
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

5. **Open in your browser**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:8089
   - Enter your username
   - Start chatting!

That's it! The app is now running on your computer. Messages will be stored locally in the SQLite database.

## Optional: GitHub Integration

If you want your messages to be backed up to GitHub:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with 'repo' scope
   - Copy the token

2. Set up GitHub integration:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template file
   cp .env.template .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your token:
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

3. Configure Git (if not already set):
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

The app will work perfectly fine without GitHub integration - your messages will still be saved locally.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **"Python command not found"**:
  - Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH
  - Try using `python` instead of `python3`

- **"Port already in use"**:
  - Another program is using port 8089
  - Close other applications or change the port in `server.py`

- **"Module not found"**:
  - Make sure you activated the virtual environment
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

- **"Database error"**:
  - Delete `database/messages.db`
  - Run `python3 init_db.py` again

- **"GitHub-related errors"**:
  - These can be safely ignored if you haven't set up GitHub integration
  - Messages will still be saved locally

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install python3
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
   
   # On Windows
   # Download and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ```

2. Verify Python installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   # Should show Python 3.7 or higher
   ```

3. (Optional) If you want to use GitHub backup:
   ```bash
   # Configure Git user
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Benavidez/GroupChat.git
   cd GroupChat
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python3 init_db.py
   ```

5. (Optional) Set up GitHub integration:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template file
   cp .env.template .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your GitHub details
   # Replace these values with your own:
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   
   # If you skip this step, the app will work without GitHub backup
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8089`
   - Set your username using the styled button in the header
   - Start chatting!

### Troubleshooting
- If you see "command not found" errors, make sure Python is installed and in your PATH
- If you get syntax errors, ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher
- If you see Git-related errors, they can be safely ignored if you haven't set up GitHub integration
- If the database fails to initialize, check that you have write permissions in the directory
- For any other issues, please check the GitHub issues page or create a new issue
